# react-flux-psadmin
ES6 attempt at building psadmin app in Pluralsight's React Flux course

- Most JS converted to ES6
- .eslintrc is experimental (no semi-colons <-- forgive me for experimenting!)
- Added babel bits
- Converting from old React + Router to the latest (at the time of writing)

This wasn an incredible learning experience. I forced myself to learn the ES6 conversions and React, and how to upgrade old react to new react.
